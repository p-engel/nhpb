# NHPB
A mechanism describing non-Hermitian photon blockade

## Use Case
The system is described by a driven Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian. The TLS (spin
qubit) has a lifetime of ~10 femto-seconds, and the cavity, ~0.7 micro-seconds.

- Calculate the average occupation number in the TLS and cavity modes.
- Calculate the second-order autocorrelation through TLS and cavity modes.
